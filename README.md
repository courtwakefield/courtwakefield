Hey there! 👋 I am a digital marketing executive with a history in web development, SEO, and design. As my daily responsibilities shift more toward leadership, I am seeking opportunities outside work to keep my programming skills up to date.<br /><br /> 

🐍 I am currently working on sandbox projects to practice my newly acquired Python skills.
